This is a visualization tool for simulated vegetation structure/succession
in space and/or time mainly for forest gap models. However, it could also be used to
visualize observed forest stands. If used for models, they should contain either
individual trees or cohorts (e.g. LPJ-GUESS: Smith et al. (2001, 2014)).
