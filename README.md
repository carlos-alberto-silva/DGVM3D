This is a visualization tool for vegetation structure/succession
in space and/or time mainly for forest gap models. However, it could also be used to
visualize observed forest stands. If used for models, they should contain either
individual trees or cohorts (e.g. [LPJ-GUESS by Smith et al. (2014)](https://dx.doi.org/10.5194/bg-11-2027-2014).
For a list of required and additional data fileds see the vignette.

For details, see the vignette in the package via (`vignette("DGVM3D", package="DGVM3D")`) or on my [GitHub.io page](https://joergsteinkamp.github.io/DGVM3D)
